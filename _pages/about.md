I am a MSc student in Communication Networks at the University of Tehran's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), under the supervision of Prof. Mehdi Kargahi. My research interests lie at the intersection of Cloud Computing and Computer Networks, with a focus on improving the performance, scalability, and fault-tolerance of modern data centers.
