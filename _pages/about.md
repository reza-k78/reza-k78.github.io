I am a MSc student in Communication Networks at the [University of Tehran's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/), under the supervision of [Prof. Mehdi Kargahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=oH19bK4AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate). My research interests lie at the intersection of Cloud Computing and Computer Networks, with a focus on improving the performance, scalability, and fault-tolerance of modern data centers.
